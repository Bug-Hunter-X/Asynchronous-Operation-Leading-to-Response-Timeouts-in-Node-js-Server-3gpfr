# Node.js Asynchronous Operation Timeout Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js applications where long-running asynchronous operations can lead to response timeouts, especially for clients with slow connections or network issues. 

The bug is caused by the server's `setTimeout` function simulating a 5-second delay in processing the request. If the client's connection is slow or has interruptions, it may result in a timeout before the response can be delivered.

## Bug Description
The original `bug.js` code exhibits this problem.  The server takes a significant delay to respond, and this becomes problematic in real-world scenarios.  The solution addresses this timeout risk using techniques to mitigate timeouts and improve the user experience.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file implements a solution that addresses potential response timeouts. The improvement involves setting a timeout on the response object, allowing for graceful handling of slow or interrupted requests. If the response isn't sent within a certain timeframe, the client receives an appropriate error message.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install express` to install the required package.
4. Execute `node bug.js` to run the buggy code and `node bugSolution.js` to run the improved code.
5. Observe the server behavior with the provided examples.

This example highlights the importance of handling asynchronous operations efficiently and implementing proper timeout mechanisms to ensure robust and reliable Node.js applications.
